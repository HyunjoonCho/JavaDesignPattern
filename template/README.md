## Template  

##### Components  

- AbstractClass  
implement template methods - which determine major function   
declare abstract methods called by template method  

- ConcreteClass  
implement abstract methods so that template methods can actually work  

##### Note  

- group common function as template for better maintenance  
- balancing role of AbstractClass(flow) and ConcreteClass(specification) matters
